### Server/GameController.cs

This is where you'll implement your game logic. You could start by defining a class for a Hangman game:

```csharp
public class HangmanGame {
    string word; // the word to guess
    string guessedLetters; // the letters the player has guessed so far

    // ... any other properties you need ...

    public HangmanGame(string word) {
        this.word = word;
        // Initialize other properties...
    }

    // Implement game logic methods here, e.g.
    // guessLetter(char letter)
    // checkWin()
    // etc.
}
```

Then, `GameController.cs` would manage instances of these games. 

```csharp
public class GameController {
    Dictionary<string, HangmanGame> games = new Dictionary<string, HangmanGame>();

    // Method to create a new game with a random word and add it to the dictionary
    // Method to remove a game when it's finished
    // etc.
}
```

### Server/GameHub.cs

This is where you'll implement your SignalR hub, which will handle real-time communication between the server and clients. You'll need to define methods for all of the operations that a client can perform, e.g.:

```csharp
public class GameHub : Hub {
    GameController gameController; // An instance of your GameController class

    public GameHub(GameController gameController) {
        this.gameController = gameController;
    }

    // A client can call this method to guess a letter in a game
    public async Task GuessLetter(string gameId, char letter) {
        // Use gameController to process the guess
        // Use Clients.Group to send a message to all clients in this game
    }

    // Define other methods as needed, e.g. StartGame, JoinGame, LeaveGame, etc.
}
```

### Client/index.html, Client/styles.css, Client/main.js

These files make up the client-side interface. `index.html` should have placeholders for all of the dynamic content, `styles.css` will define the look of the page, and `main.js` will handle user interaction and communication with the server.

For example, your `main.js` might contain something like this:

```javascript
// Create a connection to the server
var connection = new signalR.HubConnectionBuilder().withUrl("/gameHub").build();

// Start the connection
connection.start().catch(function (err) {
    return console.error(err.toString());
});

// Handle a button click
document.getElementById("guessButton").addEventListener("click", function (event) {
    var letter = document.getElementById("letterInput").value;
    connection.invoke("GuessLetter", gameId, letter).catch(function (err) {
        return console.error(err.toString());
    });
    event.preventDefault();
});

// Handle a message from the server
connection.on("ReceiveGuessResult", function (gameId, result) {
    // Update the page with the result
});
```

Please replace the above pseudo-code with actual C# and JavaScript code and use the SignalR API as required. For actual working code, I would recommend looking for a tutorial or example code that matches your use case. You will also need to handle the exception and security parts for a full fledged application.
